# Boston Airbnb Price Prediction: An investigation using Machine Learning

Performed and compared various linear regressions techniques (penalize, LASSO and Ridge), Generalized Additive Models(GAMs) and Regression trees on the Boston Airbnb [dataset](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) to investigate the following questions:

- To what degree can supervised machine learning techniques be used to assist an Airbnb host in determining an appropriate listing price for their property?

- For Airbnb data, can the categorical feature of “neighborhood” be replaced with a con- tinuous feature of driving distance to a geographic point of interest (e.g., an airport) and have comparable results?

The complete investigation and report is in `documents/final_report.pdf`

The `R` source code is in `src/boston_airbnb.Rmd`
